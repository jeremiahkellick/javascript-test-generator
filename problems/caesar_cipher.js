// Back in the good old days, you used to be able to write a darn near
// uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing
// it by a fixed number, so 'abc' by 2 would look like 'cde', wrapping around
// back to 'a' when you pass 'z'.
//
// Write a function, `caesarCipher(str, shift)` which will take a message and
// an increment amount and output the encoded message. Assume lowercase and no
// punctuation. Preserve spaces.

function caesarCipher(str, shift) {
